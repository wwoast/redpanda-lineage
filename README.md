## Summary

The global red panda population is estimated at under 10,000 animals, and around 1000 of these animals are distributed across zoos worldwide.

The Red Panda Lineage dataset is a flat-file human-editable dataset of pandas. A small group of passionate red panda lovers manually curates this dataset by making updates or commits to this repository.

When a commit is accepted, Travis CI will run the bundled Python scripts, and publish a single JSON file to the _GitHub pages_ branch of this repository. This file is queryable using the [Dagoba](https://github.com/dxnn/dagoba) graph query language, allowing a fully [browser-based red panda lineage viewer](https://redpandafinder.com) to be written. Peek at our [Design Documentation](https://github.com/wwoast/redpanda-lineage/blob/master/docs/DESIGN.md) for more details.

## Credits

This Red Panda Lineage dataset was started by _wumpwoast_ (Justin Fairchild) in June 2018, with the help and support of _firefoxpanda88_ and _daniele.tokyo_, and dedication of Red Panda fans in Japan and world-wide on Instagram and YouTube.
